## Overview
This project aims to uncover correlations between variables and pinpoint influential factors contributing to the risk of high cholesterol development in individuals. 
Through rigorous exploration and statistical examination, the study seeks to shed light on key determinants that play a crucial role in understanding and assessing the risk factors associated with elevated cholesterol levels.

## Motivation
What could be a perfect way to use the course completion period? Like most of you, I spend my time in Job Hunting, coding and reading some latest research papers on weekends. The idea struck to me when I was browsing through some studies on High cholesterol in UK. 

## Technical Aspect
This project involved implementing a predective model using logistic regression along with decision tree.
First step engaged data cleaning and identificaton of potential outliers for more accurate analysis.
Next was data visualisation and descriptive sttaistics to gain deeper understanding on different variables variation.
Followed by hypothesis testing using chi-square to investigate the relationship between categorical variables and t-test to compare means cross Birmingham and Solihull of BMI and IMD Quintile.
Last was Predictive Modelling computing different Machine Learning Techniques such as Binarary Logistic Regression, cross-validation, SMOTE Sampling, Support Vector Machine classification and decision trees. Based on Precision and Accuracy, among all, regression and decision tree were displaying the highest percentage so the final model has drawn the factors of High Cholseterol based on Decision Tree.
